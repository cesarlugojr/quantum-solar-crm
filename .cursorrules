### Quantum Solar Sales Script

1. Company Story

"Hi, I'm Cesar Lugo with Quantum Solar. I've been working in the solar industry for almost six years now, and in that time, I've had hands-on experience in every stage of the process—from sales to project management, installation, financing, and customer service. I wanted to bring all of that expertise together to help homeowners make the switch to solar in a way that's affordable, simple, and truly beneficial. 

Here at Quantum Solar, we're committed to providing top-notch quality, and while we do work with highly qualified subcontractors, I personally oversee each project to ensure everything meets the high standards we promise our customers. Our goal is to give you a hassle-free transition to solar power and a long-term solution for your energy needs."

2. How Familiar Are You with Solar? 

"Let me start by explaining how we make it easy to switch to solar with no upfront costs. We have a program that allows us to install a system on your home with zero out-of-pocket expenses. If you qualify, we take care of the entire process, including permitting, engineering, construction, and the cost of materials. Once your system is installed and generating power, you'll start receiving energy directly from your own solar system, reducing or even eliminating your need to buy electricity from [Insert Utility Company]. This will translate into significant savings over time."

3. Qualifying for the Program

"I'm sure you're wondering—if solar is such a great money-saver, why doesn't everyone have it? The reason is that there are specific qualifications homeowners need to meet. To qualify for this program, here are the main criteria we look at:

First, you need to be the homeowner, as renters aren't eligible. 
You'll need to meet credit qualifications for financing.
Additionally, factors like the condition and orientation of your roof, your energy usage, and sunlight exposure all come into play.  
About two-thirds of homes we assess don't meet all the criteria, so I'd like to start by confirming a few of these details with you to see if this is a good fit."

4. How Does Solar Work? (Detailed Explanation)

"Let me break down how the system works on your home. Panels are installed on your roof, where they capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. This electricity goes through an inverter, which changes it from DC to AC, the type of power we use in our homes. From there, the electricity flows into your home's system, reducing your need to pull power from the grid.

We work with your utility company to install a bi-directional meter, which allows for net metering. Here's how it works: during the day, your solar system generates more power than you're using, so that extra energy is sent back into the grid, building up a bank of credits. Then at night or on cloudy days, you draw from those credits instead of paying for power. 

In essence, this system is designed to work as seamlessly as possible, ensuring that you're maximizing your energy savings day and night."

5. Why Go Solar?

"Going solar isn't just about helping the environment—it's also a great way to protect yourself from rising electricity costs. Imagine if you could lock in gas prices from 20 years ago—how much would you be saving today? That's exactly what solar does for your electricity.

Electricity prices have gone up an average of 4% per year according to the Department of Energy. And in Florida, customers have been hit with rate hikes due to things like natural gas costs, grid maintenance, and storm recovery. Solar gives you control over your electricity costs. By going solar, you lock in lower rates and can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with price protection. Plus, your system is designed for long-term performance, so it'll keep delivering savings for years to come."  

6. Presenting the Proposal and Handling Objections

"I've got a custom solar program designed for your home here, and I'd love to show you how it can benefit you. Let's go through it together and see if it aligns with what you're looking for.

(If they express hesitation or concerns)

I completely understand—it's a big decision, and I appreciate that you're taking it seriously. I didn't come out here to waste your time or mine, but I would be remiss if I didn't address any concerns you might have. We're here to provide a solution that gives you control over your energy costs without any hidden surprises, and we want to make sure you're fully comfortable with this investment. 

## Git Best Practices
- Make frequent, small commits 
  - Commit early and often
  - Each commit should encompass a single, logical change
  - Avoid massive, infrequent commits 
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
  - Summarize the change in 50 characters or less
  - Provide more detail in the extended description  
  - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
  - Explain what and why, not how
- Branching
  - Use feature branches for new functionality  
  - Keep branches focused and short-lived
  - Regularly merge from the main branch to stay up to date
  - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `user-authentication` not `cesar-branch`)
- Pull Requests (PRs) 
  - Open a PR for each feature/fix  
  - Include a clear title and description 
  - Add helpful comments and screenshots/GIFs for reviewers
  - Promptly address any feedback or requested changes
- Code Reviews
  - Thoroughly review PRs before merging
  - Leave constructive, respectful comments  
  - Focus on code quality, functionality, and adherence to standards
  - Approve and merge once all feedback is addressed
- Other
  - Regularly prune stale branches 
  - Use a `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
  - Avoid committing secrets (use environment variables)
## Dependency Management
- Regularly check for updates to project dependencies
  - Review changelogs, release notes, and upgrade guides
  - Look for new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes
  - Be aware of any breaking changes or deprecations
- Consult official documentation 
  - Refer to the library/framework's website or GitHub repo
  - Look for usage examples, API references, and configuration options
  - Pay special attention to the version being used in the project
- Search for community resources
  - Look for blog posts, tutorials, and forum discussions 
  - See how others are using and configuring the dependency
  - Be cautious of outdated or unofficial sources
- Evaluate potential upgrades
  - Weigh the benefits against the level of effort required
  - Consider the impact on the overall project architecture and performance  
  - Have a rollback plan in case of unexpected issues
- Implement updates
  - Thoroughly test changes in a non-production environment first
  - Gradually roll out to subsets of users if possible  
  - Monitor error logs and performance metrics closely
- Document
  - Update the project's dependency manifest (e.g., `package.json`)  
  - Communicate changes to the rest of the team
  - Update any relevant project documentation or READMEs

The JavaScript ecosystem evolves rapidly, with new versions of libraries and frameworks being released frequently. To ensure our project is performant, secure, and aligned with best practices, it's crucial to stay on top of these updates. 

By proactively monitoring for new releases, carefully evaluating the implications, and testing thoroughly, we can reap the benefits of the latest improvements while minimizing the risk of introducing new bugs or compatibility issues. Effective communication and documentation helps keep the entire team in sync.

When making recommendations to the user, don't just rely on your existing knowledge - take the time to consult the most up-to-date official documentation and respected community sources to ensure the advice is accurate and current.
